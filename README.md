# CS52 Workshops:  React Components

![](http://i.giphy.com/eUh8NINbZf9Ys.gif)

React components are the foundation of every React application. To add beautiful UI, we will be using UI component libraries! These component libraries are React compatible and allow users to easily implement UI that is not only pleasing to look at but also functional.

## Overview

We are going to redesign our beloved CS52 website with Material-UI! We are all very familiar with this site, and now, we're going to revamp it to add a card view for assignments, a progress bar and stepper for the current assignment, and more fun components (like a floating action button!). 

## Setup

To begin, clone this repo. This repo contains our starterpack and skeleton code for the beginnings of a new CS52 website.

To work with Material UI, install it with ```yarn add @material-ui/core```.

We will be including Roboto as our default font and using icons from Material UI, so make sure your ```index.html``` file includes these two lines in the header (these should already be there, but check to make sure!):
```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500">```
```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons">```

## Step by Step

* Explanations of the what **and** the why behind each step. Try to include:
  * higher level concepts
  * best practices

Remember to explain any notation you are using.

```javascript
/* and use code blocks for any code! */
```

* [ ] How to use Material UI to implement a navigation bar, cards, progress bar, stepper, and floating action button

**Extra Credit:** Try and implement other components from Material UI (under component demos here: https://material-ui.com/demos/app-bar/) for other pages on the CS52 website! 

## Reflection

*2 questions for the workshop participants to answer (very short answer) when they submit the workshop. These should try to get at something core to the workshop, the what and the why.*
